# Game of Life
Python programming exercise

# Description
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton invented by John Horton Conway in 1970.

# Rules
The Game of Life is a "zero-player game" as it does not require any player intervention during its progression. It is a cellular automaton, a model where each state mechanically leads to the next state based on predefined rules.

The game takes place on a two-dimensional grid, theoretically infinite, where each square — called "cell" by analogy with living cells — can be in one of two distinct states: "alive" or "dead".

A cell has eight neighbors, which are the horizontally, vertically, and diagonally adjacent cells.

At each iteration, the state of a cell is entirely determined by the state of its eight neighboring cells, following the following rules:

A dead cell with exactly three living neighboring cells becomes alive (it is born).
A living cell with two or three living neighboring cells survives, otherwise it dies.
